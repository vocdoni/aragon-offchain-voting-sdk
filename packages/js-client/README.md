# Vocdoni Gasless Voting SDK for Aragon DAO

The Aragon App integrates a plugin built by Vocdoni, which uses VoChain. VoChain is a Proof of Authority blockchain. Though block production is restricted to select trusted authorities, anyone can join the network and operate their own node for synchronization and confirmation; ensuring end-to-end verifiability. Vocdoni is censorship resistant because it uses distributed ledger technology. A transaction can only be blocked if 2/3 of the Vochain authorities concur, but all actions are transparent and auditable by the community
